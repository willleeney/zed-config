/**
 * Task-completion notifications.
 *
 * Every backgrounded job that reaches a terminal state sends its OWN
 * <task-notification> XML message, exactly once, the moment it exits. pi's
 * steer delivery queues the message while the agent is streaming and
 * delivers it at the next tool-call boundary, or starts a turn when the
 * agent is idle (triggerTurn: true).
 *
 * Exactly-once is enforced by the job's `notified` latch — a check-and-set
 * done BEFORE the send, so any path that already surfaced the outcome (a
 * bg_output/bg_stop read, a deliberate kill) suppresses the notification.
 * A terminal job that has been notified is evicted from the live registry;
 * its output log stays on disk and the notification carries the path.
